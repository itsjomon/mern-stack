# CSS Part - 2
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that is used to style HTML elements.

## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

### Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)

#### Universal Selector
used to style the entire document
```css
* {
  property: value;
}
/* * is Universal Selector */
```

#### Element Selector
```css
h1 {
  property: value;
}
/* h1 is Elemet Selector*/
```

#### ID Selector
Selects an element based on the value of the element's id attribute
- It is case sensitive. eg: `#myid` & `#MYID` both are not same
```css
#myid {
  property: value;
}
/* #myid is ID Selector*/
```

#### Class Selector
Selects an element based on their class attribute
```css
.myclass {
  property: value;
}
/* .myclass is Class Selector*/
```

### Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)

#### Descendant Selector (space)
It is used to select elements that are descendants of a specified element.

Eg - Selects all paragraphs inside divs
```css
div p{
  property: value;
}
/* div p is Descendant Selector */
```

#### Adjecent/Next Sibling Combinator (+)
The adjacent sibling selector selects an element that is immediately next to a specified element.

Eg - Heading3 that comes immediately after any paragraph
```css
p + h3{
  property: value;
}
/* p + h3 is Sibling Combinator */
```

#### child Combinator (>)
The child combinator selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

Eg - Selects all buttons which are direct children of spans
```css
span > button{
  property: value;
}
/* span > button is Child Combinator */
```

### Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

#### Attribute Selector

Eg - Selects elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute
```css
input[attr="value"]{
  property: value;
}
```

### Pseudo Class
A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected selemet(s)
```css
:hover
:active
:checked
:nth-of-type
```
```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

### Pseudo Elements
A keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s)
```css
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection
```
```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```

## CSS : Cascading StyleSheets
**What is cascade in CSS?**
The `CSS cascade algorithm's` job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.

**What is specificity?**
Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.
```css
h2 {
    background-color: yellow;
}
h2 {
    background-color: blue;
}

/* final color is blue */
```
- **Cascading**: When multiple styles apply, the last one (in order) wins if specificity is equal.
- **Multiple CSS files**: The last linked file overrides earlier ones.
- **Specificity order**: Inline > ID > Class > Tag

## !important in CSS
To show the most specific thing in the document.
```css
h2 {
     background-color: "black !important";
   }
```
The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

## CSS Inheritance
- **Definition**: Inheritance means some CSS properties are automatically passed from a parent element to its children.
- **Common inherited properties**: `color`, `font-family`, `line-height`
- **Not all properties inherit**: Layout-related ones like `margin`, `padding`, `border` do not inherit by default.
- You can force inheritance using `inherit` keyword:  
  ```css
  p {
    border: inherit;
  }
