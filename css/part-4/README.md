## position

The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

- static
- relative
- absolute
- fixed

### Position - Static

The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.

This is the `default` value.

```css
position: static;
```

### Position - Relative

The offset is relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

```css
position: relative;
```

### Position - Absolute

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

It is positioned `relative to its closest positioned ancestor`, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.

```css
position: absolute;
```

### Position - Fixed

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.

It is positioned `relative to the initial containing block` established by the viewport.

```css
position: fixed;
```
